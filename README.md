Background:
You are a Data Scientist at Delta Bank, a company that is aiming to develop a customer experience vision.
Part of this vision, one important pillar is the customers retention. As a result, the business officers would
want to strengthen the relationship with the clients for keeping them engaged and assessing their needs
and pain points. Due to the costs involved, it is not possible to target all the clients of the company. Along
with the marketing team, the officers would like to understand why customers are leaving the bank and
find the most probable churners.

Your challenge is to:
1. Identify the most probable clients that will churn in the future – who are the customers that will
leave the company?
2. Identify & explain churn drivers – what are the most important factors in churn?
